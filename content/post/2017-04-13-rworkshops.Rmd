Together with Jeff Powell, I am teaching a new series of workshops in Advanced Topics in R this week. Follow the links below for each of the workshops. Also visit the informal page for the R course, and these workshops at [](http://www.hiercourse.com).

Each of the pages hosts the handouts and other materials - all are available free of charge.
